      <h1> Our vision </h1>
      <p>
         is to trace the collective behavior of interacting quantum degrees
         of freedom to an underlying principle of motion. At present, we do
         this by starting from a principle, such as:
         <ul>
            <li>the trapping of electrons on an atom in a Mott
            insulating phase;</li>
            <li>the fluctuations of spin moments within the high
            dimensional space available to them in a frustrated
            antiferromagnets;</li>
            <li>the restriction of fermions to live near their Fermi
            surface.</li>
         </ul>
         We then seek collective behavior arising in such situations. In the
         future, we may also be interested in starting from the collective
         behavior, such as:
         <ul>
            <li> topological protected/constrained motion</li>
            <li> gauge dynamics in condensed matter </li>
            <li> metal-insulator transitions </li>
         </ul>
         and seeking the underlying principle.
